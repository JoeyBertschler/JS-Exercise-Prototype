  EXAMPLE TASK:
    - Write an Airplane constructor that initializes `name` from an argument.
    - All airplanes built with Airplane should initialize with an `isFlying` of false.
    - Give airplanes the ability to `.takeOff()` and `.land()`:
        + If a plane takes off, its `isFlying` property is set to true.
        + If a plane lands, its `isFlying` property is set to false.

    TASK 1
      - Write a Person Constructor that initializes `name` and `age` from arguments.
      - All instances of Person should initialize with an empty `stomach` array.
      - Give instances of Person the ability to `.eat("someFood")`:
          + When eating an edible, it should be pushed into the `stomach`.
          + The `eat` method should have no effect if there are 10 items in the `stomach`.
      - Give instances of Person the ability to `.poop()`:
          + When an instance poops, its `stomach` should empty.
      - Give instances of Person a method `.toString()`:
          + It should return a string with `name` and `age`. Example: "Mary, 50"

    TASK 2
      - Write a Car constructor that initializes `model` and `milesPerGallon` from arguments.

          + Should cause the `odometer` to go up.
          + Should cause the the `tank` to go down taking `milesPerGallon` into account.
      - STRETCH: A car which runs out of `fuel` while driving can't drive any more distance:
          + The `drive` method should return a string "I ran out of fuel at x miles!" x being `odometer`.

  /* 
    TASK 4
    In your own words explain the four principles for the "this" keyword below:
     1 -global binding: this scope = window/global
     2 -implicit binding: refers to function that is a property aka. method
     3 -new binding: new Person/ this will adjust to new (remember jerry/newman)
        i.e. specific instance 
     4 -explicit binding: call/apply method changes what this points to

    'this' notes: 
      -not unique to js, but behaves differently
      -the dinner table analogy, if at the table u get it, if playin games in living room not (scope)
       i.e. gives you objects context
      -doesn't matter WHERE WRITTEN but instead WHERE & WHEN function is CALLED

      console.log(this) // this points to entire scope //commiting project now due to deadline, 
      working some more on this post commit
